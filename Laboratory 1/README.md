## Report

We both were already familiar with both Python and Git, so this first laboratory was pretty simple as it was just setting up things.

We downloaded PyCharm and set up that very easily as we both had already installed Python on our machines.

Then we created the project inside Pycharm as mentioned in the instruction, setting up the venv directly using the Pycharm UI. From the bottom right corner is possible to select the environment to use for running the code and through that is also possible to create a new venv for the project.

We then set up the remote repository directly using the terminal to initialize it and add the files. Then we connected it to the project as a remote repository directly with the Pycharm UI.

After all the setting up we started writing the very simple Python code for the number generation and the guessing by the player. Keeping robust code for future AWS develpments in mind we also included error handling, if the user does not input numbers. Additionally we also tried to use the Python debugger included inside Pycharm to get used to it when we will actually need to use that.

Furthermore, we setup a proper gitignore file to make sure that venv and other pycharm configuration files is not pushed to the repository.

In the end we experimented with pip freeze to generate a requirements.txt file. To do that we imported a small library and generated a requirements.txt file which included the venv setup.

The whole work process including all experimenting, coding and documentation took us about 1h 30min. We didn't encountered any particular problem or difficulties in the process since both of us had already experience with these tools.
