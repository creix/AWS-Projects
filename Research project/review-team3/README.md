# Feedback

## What was good

- We very much liked the short introduction explaining Federated Learning. The combination of real life examples and the flow diagrams gave us a good understanding of the concept in a short amount of time
- Apart from the short introductions, the tutorial was very hands-on, which we think is a good way to learn.
- The instructions were easy to follow and mostly worked as expected
- The note explaining docker compose and the link for more info was very helpful
- The topic is very interesting and suprisingly easy to get started with. This tutorial made us wanting to learn more about Federated Learning!
- The tutorial ws presented in a structured way and it was clear that the presenters had a good understanding of the topic

## What could be improved

- It was not specified that we had to install and run docker on our computer. This could be added to the prerequisites
- The flow of the tutorial was a little bit unclear. There would be great with some more explanation tying the different parts together instead of only explaining every part indivdually.
- There would have been great with some more explanation of the results we should expect from the commands. We were not sure if everything went fine or not.
- There would also be nice with some more links to further reading. If we want to learn more about the different parts of the tutorial, it would be nice to have some links to follow.

## Conclusion

All in all we think it was an interesting and concice tutorial that gave us a good basic understanding of Federated Learning. We grade the tutorial **8/10**.
